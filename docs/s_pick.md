# The component picking

We often underestimate how important it is to pick components for a new circuit boards.
Think about it for a second: the decision you are making right now to decide on using such or such part will live on with you for the life of the circuit board you are designing. Why? Because changing later on is just too much effort!

Unless you are energized as hell during the entire length of the development phase, do yourself a favor and think twice about using this component your eyes are on.

## The conservative approach to new

This is not a competition. No, the new component you just found is not better just because it has more bells and whistles. Is it even available yet?

The first thing that should come into your mind is: can I design my circuit only with components already available in my library, inventory, database, boards in production, etc.?

Picking a new component is ALWAYS more risky than using available and proven ones. You should only consider picking it new when nothing presented to you right now can do what you aim to accomplish with your circuit.

You are 100% certain nothing fits but have you asked your colleagues?
Fair enough, let's pick a new one.

## The hunt is on

Nothing more satisfying than shopping for a new toy, right?

Here are the rules of the hunt:

- Match the component specifications to your own.
- Be sure you can buy it for the entire product life and not just right now.
- Stay as far away as possible from components with a single manufacturer and/or supplier equivalent, regardless how awesome you think this component might be.
- Watch for the price tag at your desired volume.
- Check around you: could it be possible someone else in your team may use it too?
