# Introduction

I have observed that many of us, electronics designers, tend to rush to design new circuit boards because they are cheap and easy to manufacture, allowing many iterations and room for errors.

The main oversights I have noticed are:

- lack of definition and specifications
- lack of communication between interdisciplinary teams
- lack of design organization and rules
- lack of reviews from peers
- lack of admitting our own errors and oversights.

From hobbyist to experienced product design teams, those shortcomings can be present in some degrees.
Just spending a bit time on electrical forums unravels a world where the lack of technical knowledge is not the only the problem but rather one of the points listed above.

In this guide I would like to cover as much as possible on the best practices and design workflows to adopt for **any** wannabe electronics designer, from beginners to experienced engineers.

## The structure

I would like to cover the full design worflow from an idea emerging in someone's head to a, hopefully, flawlessly functioning circuit board shipping in a high-volume product. As I already said, I believe this design workflow should apply to hobbyist project too.

Therefore, the structure of this guide is as follow:

1. Gather ideas and organize them into clean-looking system diagrams
0. Pick components the right way and draw the most intuitive circuits
0. Setup the layout phase for success: first place and constraint then route 
0. Review and iterate
0. Validate the different levels of the circuit and system
0. Brace yourself for certification

Note that I don't intend to keep this structure stale if a better one comes around the corner.

## The mindset

If you aim to design and/or become a great electronics designer, you'll be aiming for excellence at every corner.

That is why in this guide I am using an aggressive mindset which intends to leave "chance" out of the picture, even though we all need luck for everything to come together perfectly well the first time.

The idea is to think that the circuit board you are designing is your **only** possible iteration, because you don't have budget for another one, and you really, really want it to be successful.

## The miscellaneous

I'm not saying this guide is perfect for everyone, it will never be. I am also not pretending I have the answers to everything and every team. I am attempting my best shot at describing how my ideal design flow is like in my mind, so you are welcome to critize it and give me feedback.

With that said, let's dive into it.
