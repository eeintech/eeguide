# The component picking

We often underestimate how important it is to pick components for a new circuit boards.
Think about it for a second: the decision you are making right now to use such or such part will likely live on for the life of the circuit board you are designing. Why? Because changing it later on is just too much effort!

Unless you are energized as hell during the entire length of the development phase, do yourself a favor and think twice about using this component your eyes are on.

## The conservative approach

No, this is not a competition. The brand new component you just found is not better than its widely used counterpart just because it has more bells and whistles. Have you checked if it is even available yet?

The first thing that should come into your mind is: can I design my circuit board only with components available in libraries, inventory, database or boards in production which have already been vetted by my peers? Picking a new component is ALWAYS more risky than using available and proven ones. You should only consider picking it new when nothing presented to you right now can do what you aim to accomplish with your circuit.

You are 100% sure nothing fits... did you confirm with your colleagues? Fair enough, let's pick a new one.

## The hunt is on

Nothing more satisfying than shopping for a new toy, right?

Here are the rules of the hunt:

- Match the component specifications to your minimum set of requirements: extras are unecessary and can lead to undesired suprises.
- Use the most generic components you can find: the more generic the more likely it can be reused for other boards.
- Be certain that you can buy it for the entire product life and not just right now.
- Stay as far away as possible from components with a single manufacturer and/or supplier equivalent, regardless how awesome you think this component might be.
- Watch for the price tag, especially at your desired volume.
