# Ideas and System Diagram

It starts here: you, your colleagues or your company got many ideas about making a brand new exciting product and it involves designing one or more circuit boards interacting together.
I am going to assume you are in the execution team: you are responsible for one or more of those circuit boards to see the light of day.

The genesis of this product is full of ideas either in your head or from people throwing them at you.
You do your research and get really excited about it, then you open your favorite electronics CAD tool to create a project and start the design process.

## Define

Despite the urge to dive into the design process already, it requires you to define the main functions of each board, the different features and specifications you will need to meet.

## Visualize

Once you have gone through the definition phase, the next logical step is to represent the system with a neat looking block diagram which allwos everybody to quickly vizualize the different components and interaction between them.

## Review

Now that you have made this nice diagram:

- Are all the functions captured by the different components?
- Will the product specifications be met with this system?
- Are there any missing feature?

Share it with all the people involved in this designing the product and make them approve it.

## Plan

This part is up for grab depending how you, your team or company function, but it is nonetheless important to layout the different phases of the development of the circuit boards.

## Proof of Concept

This is an optional step but can lead to many discoveries before starting desiging new circuit boards.
If you have access to existing boards, like controller-enabled platforms and evaluation kits, test out the functions of the circuit board you intend to design to find out if there is anything you haven't thought in the product specifications that cannot be met with your current system diagram.
