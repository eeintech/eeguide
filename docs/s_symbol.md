# The symbols

The first part of designing a circuit is to draw symbols for all your components, you want them as obvious as possible.

## The right flow

What is the opposite of obvious is to draw them as their physical form, eg. their actual package on the board.
The circuit is not the place for that, the circuit should make anybody understand what it does, not what it looks like physically on the board (there is the layout file for that).

I have seen so many instance of circuit with their microcontroller drawn exactly like their physical package, those are the worse schematics to read: do you really want to tilt your head left and right to figure what is connected to which pin?

Instead try this:
