Just spending a bit time on https://electronics.stackexchange.com/ unravels a world where the lack of technical knowledge is usually not the problem, rather one the points listed above.</p> <p>In this guide I would like to cover as much as possible on the best practices to adopt for any wannabe electronics designer, from beginners to experienced engineers.</p>"}]}
