# The block diagram

It starts here: you, your colleagues or your company got many ideas about making a brand new exciting product and it involves designing one or more circuit boards interacting together.
I am going to assume you are in the execution team: you are responsible for one or more of those circuit boards to see the light of day.

The genesis of this product is full of ideas either in your head or from people throwing them at you.
You do your research and get really excited about it, then you open your favorite CAD tool to create a project and start the design process.

## The definition

Despite the urge to dive into the design process already, building a new system and product requires you to define the main functions of each circuit board, in addition to the different features and specifications you'll be aiming for.

If you're in a team or work with some people involved in the project, sit down with them and write down everything about the results of the conversation. Then assign priorities to each feature, importance to each specification, etc.
It is valid for solo work too, challenge yourself until you do have a clear view on what this system and product should do.

## The visualization

Now that you have defined the system with words, then your next task is to build a visual representation of it, starting with a neat looking system diagram. Visuals will help you and your team understand, at a glimpse, what it is that you will be designing. Then drill down to board level and repeat the same process with each single one.

Never skip this step, system and board block diagrams are a must and should allow anybody to quickly vizualize the different components and interaction between them. Any additional visual cues are welcome too, the more the merrier.

## The review

After drawing those nice diagrams, make sure to pause and review them:

- Will the product specifications be met with this system?
- Are all the functions captured by the different boards and components?
- Are there any missing feature?

Share them with all the people involved in designing the product and **get their approval**, as you shouldn't waste time working on something that is not the right thing.

More on this topic [in the next section](../review/).

## The planning

This part is up for grab depending how you, your team or company function, but it is nonetheless important to layout the different phases of the development of the circuit boards so that you are all onboard with the schedule.

I have experienced counterless times unrealistic timelines for board development and manufacturing expectation, it is almost inevitable as we all think we can make this happen quikly and seamlessly. Then stress levels arise when things go south, do not panic and keep your head in the game as there are more important things to worry about!

## The proof of concept

This is an optional step but can lead to many discoveries before starting desiging new circuit boards.
If you have access to existing boards, like controller-enabled platforms and evaluation kits, test out the functions of the circuit board you intend to design to find out if there is anything you haven't thought in the product specifications that cannot be met with your current plan.
