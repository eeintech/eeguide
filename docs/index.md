# Welcome to Electronics Best Practices and Design Guide

I have observed that many of us, electronics designers, tend to rush to design new circuit boards because they are cheap and easy to manufacture, allowing many iterations and room for errors.

The main oversights I have noticed are:
- lack of definition and specifications
- lack of communication between interdisciplinary teams
- lack of design organization and rules
- lack of reviews from peers
- lack of admitting our own errors and oversights.

From hobbyist to experienced product design teams, those shortcomings can be present in some degrees.
Just spending a bit time on https://electronics.stackexchange.com/ unravels a world where the lack of technical knowledge is usually not the problem, rather one the points listed above.

In this guide I would like to cover as much as possible on the best practices to adopt for **any** wannabe electronics designer, from beginners to experienced engineers.
